## Summary

<!-- Give a short summary of what the problem is. Note: Before submitting an error report, please test if the problem is reproducible in the latest Slicer Preview Release and using the lastest version of the extension. If the problem does not occur in the latest Slicer Preview Release/Extension then most likely it has been already fixed and there is no need to report it again. -->

## Steps to reproduce

<!--
    Generally, developers can only fix those issues that they can reproduce on their computers.

    To achieve this, please:
    * Describe in this section what you did, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead.
    * Attach a few screenshots if possible.

    To describe "Actual behavior" and "Expected behavior" you may use the following format:
    1. Do A
    2. Do B => Slicer does Y - OK
    3. Do C => Slicer does Z => ERROR: Slicer should do W instead
    4. Do D => Slicer does Z - OK
    5. Do B => Slicer does Y => ERROR: Slicer should do X instead
-->
